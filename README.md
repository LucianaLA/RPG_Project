# RPG_Project

o	Why are we doing this?
To test our knowledge of Spring Boot, java and agile development.

o	How I expected the challenge to go.
Badly

o	What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
I managed to do the tests which was the part I was least confident in. I had issues with git and also postman requests which was unexpected since I was confident on those.

o	Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
Remember to push project often and on time.

o	Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API.

o	Screenshots of your database to prove that data is being persisted.

o	Screenshot of your test results, including coverage report.
